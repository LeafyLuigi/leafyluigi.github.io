    <h1 class="no-margin">Hello!</h1>
    <h2>This is my site, I guess.</h2>
    <br/>
    <p>Here's the sort of stuff I've been doing recently:</p>
    <br/>
    <p class="no-margin">
      <span class="monospace">[XML / Haxe / HScript]</span>
      I made a mod called "LeafTech" for a game called
      <a class="italic" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/876650/">Aground</a>.
      You can find it <a href="https://aground.mod.io/leaftech">here</a>
      or
      <a href="https://discord.gg/tX2ZxaUYDH">here</a>
      .
    </p>
    <p class="no-margin">
      <span class="monospace">[CSS]</span>
      I'm making a theme of sorts for Discord because the stock dark theme sucks ass and I want to have an
      <a class="hidden" href="https://anilist.co/anime/20997/Charlotte/">anime</a>
      background. The background is completely customizable.
      <span class="monospace small">(There's currently no link to it as it's not fucking done. It's still using temp images and colors ffs.)</span>
    </p>
    <p class="no-margin tiny">
      <span class="monospace">[HTML / CSS]</span>
      oh and i made this site
    </p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p class="monospace">Historical: </p>
    <p class="no-margin">
      <span class="monospace">[CASIO BASIC]</span>.
      A mod to a minesweeper game/program for the
      <span class="italic">Casio ClassPad</span>.
      It was never made public and the source code will likely forever work on my old ClassPad, if I can find it. I can no longer find the link to the original program unfortunately.
