    <p>Here's the sort of stuff I've been doing recently:</p>
    <br/>
    <p class="no-margin">
      <span class="monospace">[CSS]</span>
      I'm making a theme of sorts for Discord (named "Pyrite") because the stock dark theme sucks ass and I want to have an
      <a class="hidden" href="https://anilist.co/anime/20997/Charlotte/">anime</a>
      background. The background is completely customizable. You can find a link for the support server somewhere on the repo. Image license usage can be found on the repo
      <a href="https://github.com/LeafyLuigi/discord-themes/tree/master/pyrite">here</a>
      .
    </p>
    <p class="no-margin">
      <span class="monospace">[HTML / CSS / JS]</span>
      I've also written up a list of variables used in the theme above explaining a few things. Javascript is barely used but somehow it worked. You can see it
      <a href="https://leafyluigi.github.io/discord-themes/pyrite/var-examples.html">here</a>
      .

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p class="monospace">Historical:</p>
      <p class="no-margin">
      <span class="monospace">[XML / Haxe / HScript]</span>
      I made a mod called "LeafTech" for a game called
      <a class="italic" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/876650/">Aground</a>.
      You can find it <a href="https://aground.mod.io/leaftech">here</a> should it be public.
    </p>
    <p class="no-margin">
      <span class="monospace">[CASIO BASIC]</span>.
      A mod to a minesweeper game/program for the
      <span class="italic">Casio ClassPad</span>.
      It was never made public and the source code will likely forever work on my old ClassPad, if I can find it. I can no longer find the link to the original program unfortunately.
